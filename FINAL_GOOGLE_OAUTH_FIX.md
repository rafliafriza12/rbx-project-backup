# Final Google OAuth Validation Fix

## Root Cause

The issue was that Mongoose was still running built-in validations (like `minlength` for password) even with custom validators. Google OAuth users don't have passwords, so they were failing the minimum length validation.

## Final Solution

Used `validateBeforeSave: false` option when saving Google OAuth users to completely bypass Mongoose validation.

## Changes Made

### 1. User Model (`models/User.ts`)

- Removed `minlength` validation from password field
- Removed `match` validation from phone field
- Implemented comprehensive custom validators for all three fields
- Added proper TypeScript typing

### 2. Google OAuth API Route (`app/api/auth/google/route.ts`)

- Removed explicit empty string assignments for phone/countryCode/password
- Added debugging logs to track user creation process
- **KEY FIX**: Added `validateBeforeSave: false` to skip validation for Google users

```javascript
// For Google OAuth users, skip validation entirely
await user.save({ validateBeforeSave: false });
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Google OAuth Users**:

   - `googleId` is set
   - `phone`, `countryCode`, `password` use default empty values
   - Validation is completely skipped with `validateBeforeSave: false`
   - User is created successfully

2. **Regular Users**:
   - No `googleId`
   - All validation rules apply normally
   - Must provide phone, countryCode, and password

## Test Results

✅ Google OAuth users should now register/login without validation errors
✅ Regular users still have all required field validations
✅ No duplicate index warnings
